## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm package manager
- Local Operator Backend (for full functionality testing)

### Development Setup

1. If you don't have contributor access, **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-operator-ui.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd local-operator-ui
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to configure the connection to your Local Operator backend.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Code Style & Quality

We enforce consistent code style and quality checks:

- **Formatting & Linting**: Uses Biome

  ```bash
  # Check for linting issues
  pnpm lint

  # Fix linting issues
  pnpm lint:fix

  # Format code
  pnpm format

  # Fix formatting issues
  pnpm format:fix
  ```

- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking is enforced

Always run these tools before submitting a pull request. They will also be run in the CI pipeline on any branches with the `dev-` prefix and on PRs merged to `main`.

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use `type` instead of `interface` for type definitions
- Use kebab-case for file names and PascalCase for component names
- Use named exports instead of default exports
- Include JSDoc documentation where appropriate
- Follow Biome linting conventions
- Break large components into smaller, manageable, testable components
- Use styled components and MUI for UI elements

## Testing

We use Jest for testing:

```bash
pnpm test
```

- Keep tests in the same directory as the components they test
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage for new features
- Use React Testing Library for component tests

## Contribution Workflow

Please follow the following steps to contribute:

1. For accounts without contributor access, create your fork of the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes with the `dev-` prefix

   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev-my-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b dev-issue-number-description
   ```

3. Commit changes with descriptive messages

   - Use the present tense
   - Keep commits small and atomic

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature for specific component"
   ```

4. Update documentation if adding new features or changing behavior

5. Push your changes to your fork

   ```bash
   git push origin dev-my-feature
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request against the main branch of the upstream repository

## Release Process

Once approved and merged, maintainers will package changes into releases with the following procedure:

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Create a git tag with prefix `v` (for example `v0.2.0`)
3. Push the tag to the upstream repository on the commit to release on `main`
4. Create a release from the tag on GitHub with a concise release name and a description of the changes
5. CD will trigger on release creation and build the application for distribution on `npm`

**For pre-release versions**:

- Use the `alpha` or `beta` suffix (for example `v0.2.0-alpha.1`)
- Update the version in `package.json` on the `dev-` branch
- Releases can be created by maintainers from the `dev-` branch if they are not ready to be merged to main

## Pull Request Checklist

- Tests added/updated
- Documentation updated (README, JSDoc comments)
- Code formatted with Biome
- Linting passes
- Type checking passes
- All CI checks pass
- UI/UX considerations addressed (for user-facing features)
- Responsive design considerations addressed

## Reporting Issues

When filing an issue, please include:

1. Local Operator UI version
2. Operating system
3. Node.js version
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Expected vs actual behavior
6. Error logs (if applicable)
7. Screenshots (for UI issues)
