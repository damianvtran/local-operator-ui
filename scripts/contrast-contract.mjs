/**
 * The theme contrast contract, executable.
 *
 *     node scripts/contrast-contract.mjs
 *
 * Loads every palette this app ships, recomputes each foreground x ground pair
 * the design system permits, and asserts the floors in `docs/branding.md` § 3.
 * Exits non-zero on a violation. No dependencies, plain `node` >= 18.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * With twelve user-selectable themes and no floor, unreadable colour is not an
 * oversight, it is the expected outcome. Measured against the light theme as it
 * shipped before this contract existed:
 *
 *   | Pair                                            | Ratio  |
 *   |-------------------------------------------------|--------|
 *   | `primary.main` #2BA458 as text on paper #FFFFFF | 3.20:1 |
 *   | a contained button's own label on its own fill  | 3.20:1 |
 *   | active sidebar item text on the sidebar ground  | 2.74:1 |
 *   | an input's only border against its own field    | 1.25:1 |
 *
 * None of those are adversarial cases. They are the default light theme's own
 * values, and they were invisible because nothing measured them. This measures
 * them, on every palette, on every run.
 *
 * ## What it asserts that a token-pair checker does not
 *
 *   1. **Component triples** (ground + fill + border + ink), not just pairs. A
 *      control's boundary is legal if EITHER its fill or its border clears 3:1
 *      against the ground behind it. That is what catches "the fill is 1.06:1
 *      and the border is 1.20:1, so the control has no perceivable edge".
 *   2. A colour used as a **background is treated as a ground**, so pointing a
 *      hover-fill token at a saturated accent fails here instead of shipping.
 *   3. Every accepted sub-floor pair is **pinned to its measured ratio**. An
 *      exemption is not a mute button: change the token and the pinned value
 *      stops matching, and the exemption is re-litigated.
 *
 * ## What it does not do, because a check's scope is itself a claim
 *
 * It asserts over the pairs and triples enumerated below. That enumeration is a
 * human judgement about what the system permits and is the part most likely to
 * be wrong — a pair nobody listed passes silently, which in the output is
 * indistinguishable from a pair that passes because it is legible.
 *
 *   - Adding a component means adding a row to `CONTROLS`. Green output on an
 *     unlisted component is not evidence about that component.
 *   - It computes sRGB ratios from flat hexes. It cannot see an alpha
 *     composite, a gradient, text over an image, or a colour a third-party
 *     widget (ag-grid, CodeMirror, mermaid) picked for itself. Those need a
 *     human and a screenshot.
 *
 * Do not read a clean run as "the app is accessible". Read it as "every
 * pairing we have written down still holds, on all twelve themes".
