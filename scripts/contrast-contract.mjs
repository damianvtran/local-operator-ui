/**
 * The theme contrast contract, executable.
 *
 *     node scripts/contrast-contract.mjs
 *
 * Loads every palette this app ships, recomputes each foreground x ground pair
 * the design system permits, and asserts the floors in `docs/branding.md` § 3.
 * Exits non-zero on a violation. No dependencies, plain `node` >= 18.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * With twelve user-selectable themes and no floor, unreadable colour is not an
 * oversight, it is the expected outcome. Measured against the light theme as it
 * shipped before this contract existed:
 *
 *   | Pair                                            | Ratio  |
 *   |-------------------------------------------------|--------|
 *   | `primary.main` #2BA458 as text on paper #FFFFFF | 3.20:1 |
 *   | a contained button's own label on its own fill  | 3.20:1 |
 *   | active sidebar item text on the sidebar ground  | 2.74:1 |
 *   | an input's only border against its own field    | 1.25:1 |
 *
 * None of those are adversarial cases. They are the default light theme's own
 * values, and they were invisible because nothing measured them. This measures
 * them, on every palette, on every run.
 *
 * ## What it asserts that a token-pair checker does not
 *
 *   1. **Component triples** (ground + fill + border + ink), not just pairs. A
 *      control's boundary is legal if EITHER its fill or its border clears 3:1
 *      against the ground behind it. That is what catches "the fill is 1.06:1
 *      and the border is 1.20:1, so the control has no perceivable edge".
 *   2. A colour used as a **background is treated as a ground**, so pointing a
 *      hover-fill token at a saturated accent fails here instead of shipping.
 *   3. Every accepted sub-floor pair is **pinned to its measured ratio**. An
 *      exemption is not a mute button: change the token and the pinned value
 *      stops matching, and the exemption is re-litigated.
 *
 * ## What it does not do, because a check's scope is itself a claim
 *
 * It asserts over the pairs and triples enumerated below. That enumeration is a
 * human judgement about what the system permits and is the part most likely to
 * be wrong — a pair nobody listed passes silently, which in the output is
 * indistinguishable from a pair that passes because it is legible.
 *
 *   - Adding a component means adding a row to `CONTROLS`. Green output on an
 *     unlisted component is not evidence about that component.
 *   - It computes sRGB ratios from flat hexes. It cannot see an alpha
 *     composite, a gradient, text over an image, or a colour a third-party
 *     widget (ag-grid, CodeMirror, mermaid) picked for itself. Those need a
 *     human and a screenshot.
 *
 * Do not read a clean run as "the app is accessible". Read it as "every
 * pairing we have written down still holds, on all twelve themes".

 * Semantics a reader has to tell apart, and how far apart they must be.
 *
 * `accent` is deliberately absent. In the two brand palettes `accent` and
 * `success` are both the brand green — ΔE00 2.2 and 5.1 — because the brand
 * has one hue and "it worked" is the state it is happiest to own. That is a
 * decision, not a defect: nothing in the product asks a user to distinguish
 * an accent from a success, whereas `success` against `info` is a distinction
 * a callout exists to make. A gate that fails by design teaches people to
 * silence gates, so accent is out of the family rather than pinned as an
 * exception in every palette.
 *
 * The floor is 15 and it is a judgement about *recall*, not comparison. A
 * ΔE00 around 2.3 is where a difference becomes visible with both colours
 * side by side; nobody reads callouts that way. A user meets one callout,
 * alone, and has to categorise it against a memory of what green meant last
 * week — and that needs a difference of category, not of shade. 15 is roughly
 * six times the side-by-side threshold, which is the region where two colours
 * reliably take different names.
 *
 * It is not calibrated to the tree. The closest legitimate pair in the twelve
 * is dune's `danger`/`info` at 18.4 (a red-orange beside an orange), which
 * clears 15 by 23 percent; the three pairs that ever failed this — the two

	/* Adjacent grounds must be a perceptible step, not merely a passing ratio.
	   D21 established that 1.03:1 is a gate floor, not a human threshold -
	   sage's canvas/surface at 1.9 dE00 renders a visible card boundary and
	   localOperatorLight at 1.5 did not.

	   `canvas`/`sunken` is not in this list, and the reason it used to give -
	   "they are never adjacent on screen" - was false: `output-block.tsx` and
	   `log-block.tsx` render `bg-sunken` inside a trace that sits on `canvas`.
	   The real reason is that the pair cannot be separated by luminance in the
	   near-black palettes at all: obsidian's canvas is #09090B and its sunken
	   #030307, ΔE00 1.23, and there is no darker value left to move to that is
	   not black. So those two blocks now carry `border-hairline`. Their sibling
	   `error-block.tsx` has always been bounded too, though by a louder edge -
	   `border-danger-border` on `bg-danger-wash` - because it is reporting a
	   failure; the hairline is the neutral form of the same idea.

	   That edge is asserted here, against all four grounds it is drawn on. It
	   is NOT in `STRUCTURAL`, and an earlier version of this comment claimed it
	   was: `STRUCTURAL` holds `borderControl` and asserts a 3:1 ratio, which a
	   hairline is designed never to reach - a separator that shouted would be a
	   border. Perceptibility is the right question for it, and ΔE00 is what
	   asks it.

	   But NOT at the same floor. 2.0 was calibrated on adjacent ground FIELDS -
	   two large planes meeting - and a 1px line is not a field. The frames
	   proved the difference: at 2.10, localOperatorDark's dropdown separator
	   rendered byte-identical to the panel around it, while the same 2.0 floor
	   is plainly enough for a card sitting on a canvas. A line has almost no
	   area to integrate over, so it needs roughly twice the separation to
	   register at all. Hence two floors, and the line floor is the one that
	   moved five palettes. */
	/* The accent's three states are a ramp the user reads as one control
	   changing, so each step has to be visible for the same reason the ground
	   steps do. Nothing asserted them until now, which is how round 5's
	   pressed-fill repair could cut dracula's rest-to-pressed distance from
	   10.43 to 5.72 without a single gate noticing. These are fields - a whole
	   button fill - so they take the field floor. */
