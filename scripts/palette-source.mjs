/**
 * The one place that reads palette values out of the palette TypeScript.
 *
 * Two scripts need these values - `contrast-contract.mjs` asserts over them and
 * `generate-theme-css.mjs` emits CSS from them - and until this file existed
 * they each carried their own copy of the parser. That is the shape of bug this
 * module exists to prevent: two parsers that agree with each other are
 * indistinguishable from two parsers that are both correct, right up until one
 * is fixed and the other is not. A gate that reads the source differently from
 * the generator it is gating is not a gate.
 *
 * Why parse text at all rather than importing the modules: the palettes are
 * TypeScript and these scripts deliberately have no build step, so they cannot
 * `import` them. That constraint is real and worth stating - it means a palette
 * assembled at runtime, or spread from another object, is invisible here. The
 * completeness check in `palette-contract.ts` is what keeps the parse honest:
 * every role must be written out literally in each palette file, and a palette
 * that omits one fails rather than being silently skipped.
