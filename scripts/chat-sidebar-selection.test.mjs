/**
 * The current row's ground, executable — in the chat sidebar and in the settings
 * rail.
 *
 *     node --test scripts/chat-sidebar-selection.test.mjs
 *
 * The operator's report was "the sidebar doesn't visibly highlight the selected
 * conversation, so you can't tell from the sidebar which one is selected". The
 * chat panel is `bg-surface`; the ground every current-row state used was
 * `accent-wash`, which is ΔE00 1.05 from `surface` in tokyoNight — no mark at
 * all — while the hover step the same rows carry measures 4.58 there, so the
 * pointer read as the current row and the current row did not. The settings rail
 * (round 1, D2) is the same pairing on the same ground and is covered here for
 * that reason: it is one class in another file for one role decision, and a
 * second file asserting the same property for the same decision would be two
 * instruments for one fact.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY EACH NEEDS ITS OWN INSTRUMENT:
 *
 *   1. the GROUND a current row paints is a step off its panel, not a wash —
 *      read off the shipped class strings, because no palette assertion can see
 *      a class and every one of them stayed green while this shipped; *   2. the ground SURVIVES THE POINTER, resolved through the SHIPPED `cn` over
 *      the expression the component actually passes. This is the instrument
 *      round 1 asked for and the reason this file no longer merges strings it
 *      wrote itself: the property is a tailwind-merge resolution (the two
 *      `hover:bg-*` land in one conflict group and the LAST one wins), so a
 *      call-site reorder, or dropping the `hover:` half, or moving the ground
 *      off the element that carries the hover step, all move it. The entity
 *      row's ground is on two elements for exactly that reason — a child's
 *      background paints over its parent's — so `merged()` below resolves every
 *      element of a current row that this file's `CURRENT` table names, and a
 *      separate assertion counts the `hover:bg-*` class literals in both panels
 *      and requires the file to account for every one of them, so a control
 *      added to a row cannot be resolved by nobody;
 *   3. every current-row state in those two panels takes the same role — the
 *      four chat call sites, the entity row's three elements, and the settings
 *      rail's row are one fact.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT PROVE: that the ground is *visible*. That is a property of the
 * role against its neighbours across twelve palettes, and it is
 * `scripts/contrast-contract.mjs`'s job — it asserts `highlight` against
 * `surface`, `elevated` and `sunken` at the field floor of ΔE00 2.0, with the
 * authored values measuring 2.18-2.28 from `surface`, 2.52-5.05 from `elevated`
 * (the row's hover step, the binding pair) and 2.15-15.43 from `sunken`. It also
 * cannot prove the row reads as the current one on screen; that is the frames in
 * `docs/evidence/chat-sidebar-selection/`.
 *
 * PROCEDURE NOTE. The sidebar cannot be rendered in isolation — it reads the
 * router, the canonical-sessions store and the desktop capability hooks — and
 * this repository's desktop suite has no DOM harness, so the rows' `cn(...)`
 * expressions are read as source TEXT and then RUN against the real `cn`, with
 * every predicate stubbed true so the merged answer is the class list the
 * current row really carries. The comment scanner below is the one in
 * `scripts/new-chat-row.test.mjs`: comments have to come out before class
 * literals are read, or a note explaining the ground re-arms a pin (that file
 * records the round it bit).
