/* Pure state machine for the async site-access flow, DOM- and chrome-free for
 * the pure-node test suite — the same pattern as pair-flow.ts/origin-flow.ts.
 *
 * Why this flow exists at all: the original design answered a first visit to a
 * new origin by BLOCKING the open/goto RPC inside the 60 s popup prompt. The
 * agent never got a turn to tell the user a prompt was up, so prompts expired
 * unseen (auto-deny), the daemon meanwhile extended the command's deadline,
 * and the session client timed out with a misleading "bridge unreachable" — a
 * real session burned an hour misdiagnosing the bridge as broken. The fix is
 * to make approval a first-class three-step dance the agent can narrate:
 * open fails early → request_access raises the prompt and returns → the agent
 * TELLS the user → await_access waits for the decision.
 *
 * Multi-surface constraint (round-1 review, B1): parallel sessions now each
 * drive their OWN tab, and this state is extension-global. Everything that
 * carries authority — a pending request, a once-grant — is therefore bound to
 * the REQUESTER (the daemon's per-command request id, which one session owns
 * and another cannot guess). A grant minted for session A's flow can never be
 * spent by session B's navigation: consumption fails CLOSED when the caller
 * cannot prove it asked. A shared-grant model was considered and rejected:
 * "Allow once" is the user's answer to "should THIS agent open THIS site",
 * and letting a different agent ride it turns one approval into a fleet-wide
 * permission — indistinguishable from "always" for the other sessions. */
