/**
 * Obsidian.
 *
 * A monochrome shadcn-style theme. Carried straight from the old file: zinc
 * 950, 900 and 800 as the three upper grounds, zinc 50 as both ink and
 * accent, zinc 500 as secondary text and zinc 600 as the inactive tone.
 *
 * The interesting problem here is that a monochrome theme still has to signal
 * danger. The four semantic hues are the lowest-chroma tints that clear the
 * floors, so they read as tinted greys rather than as candy dropped onto a
 * grey theme — and info stays fully monochrome.
