 * Neon.
 *
 * Tron-inspired, and the most saturated of the ten. Carried: the two
 * near-black blues, the grey inks, the cyan trio, the cyberpunk pink and the
 * orange the old file already used for its caution highlights. The theme's
 * glow effects live in the base theme, not here — a palette has no shadows.
