 * Dracula.
 *
 * Values come from the upstream Dracula spec — background 282A36, darker
 * background 21222C, selection 44475A, foreground F8F8F2, comment 6272A4,
 * purple, pink, green, orange, red and cyan — and from the app's previous
 * dracula-theme.ts, which carried the same purple trio.
 *
 * The scheme already owns six named hues, so nothing here is invented: the
 * warning is Dracula's orange and the info is Dracula's cyan rather than a
 * fourth colour nobody could name.
