/**
 * The two brand palettes, and the reference implementation of the role
 * contract.
 *
 * These carry the Local Operator design kit's own values — the same warm
 * ramp, accent and semantic triples the marketing site ships, so a user
 * moving from local-operator.com into the app lands on the same surface.
 * Every other palette in this directory is a community or third-party identity
 * and only has to *satisfy* the contract; these two *are* the brand, so when
 * the two disagree, these win.
 *
 * ## Where these deviate from the kit, and why that is allowed
 *
 * `docs/branding.md` settles the precedence: on the *brand* the kit wins, on
 * *how a desktop app should behave* this repo wins, "because a tool read for
 * hours at arm's length is not a page read once". Exactly two things invoke
 * that second clause. No hue the kit owns has been retuned to buy contrast
 * headroom — a brand colour changes in the kit and is followed here, never
 * the other way round.
 *
 * 1. **The light ground ramp** is wider than the site's. A page renders one
 *    surface; this app stacks four, and the kit's near-white ladder made a
 *    panel on canvas and a popover on that panel the same pixel to the eye.
 *    See the ramp comment in `localOperatorLight`.
 * 2. **`info` is not a kit role at all.** The site has no fourth semantic, so
 *    there is nothing here to be faithful to; see the `info` comment in
 *    `localOperatorDark`.
 *
 * ## The warm neutral rule
 *
 * The ramp holds `R > G > B` in light and `R >= G > B` in dark. That is what
 * makes it read as paper and ink rather than as grey, and it is the one
 * structural property a palette cannot fake with a hue rotation. A theme does
 * not have to be warm, but its neutrals must be *consistently* tinted in one
 * direction — mixed-temperature neutrals are what make a palette look
 * accidental.
 *
 * @see docs/branding.md § 2 — the ramp and why it is tinted

		 * The kit has no `info` role: on the site, "informational" is carried by
		 * the accent, because a fourth semantic hue is a hue nobody can name.
		 * The app needs one anyway — `palette.info` is read by application code
		 * and by MUI's own Alert — and it used to be defined as the accent's
		 * own triple, to keep "one accent, spent about three times per screen"
		 * true.
		 *
		 * That was the wrong thing to economise on. It made `success` and
		 * `info` the same signal: ΔE00 5.1 apart in this palette, 2.2 in the
		 * light one, with washes that were byte-identical. A user cannot be
		 * asked to tell "it worked" from "here is a fact" by colour when the
		 * two colours are the same colour, and the accent budget is about how
		 * often accent is *spent*, not about refusing to name a fourth state.
		 * Every other palette in this directory separates them by 26 to 47.
		 *
		 * So `info` is a blue, which is the reading users already expect, and
		 * it is a warm one: L*72 C*36 at Lab hue 272, which leans to the red
		 * side of blue rather than the cyan side. A cyan would have sat next
		 * to the brand green in hue and read as a fifth tint of it; a cold
		 * azure on a warm near-black reads as pasted in. The wash keeps the
		 * canvas's own red floor (R 25 against canvas R 22, the same trick
		 * `successWash` uses) so it tints the ground rather than replacing it.
		 *
		 * Measured: 8.60:1 on canvas, 8.03:1 on surface, 7.34:1 on its own
		 * wash; ΔE00 41.0 from `success`, 46.1 from `accent`.

		/*
		 * The four grounds are a lightness ladder, and on a light theme the top
		 * of it is cramped: `elevated` is already a shade off white, so there
		 * is almost no headroom above `surface`. The gate's floor here is a
		 * 1.03 luminance ratio, and clearing it is not the same test as being
		 * able to see the step. This ramp cleared the gate and failed the eye:
		 * `canvas`/`surface` measured ΔE00 1.53 and `surface`/`elevated` 1.14,
		 * and in the captured theme frames a plain card on canvas simply did
		 * not read as a separate surface. The observed threshold, from the same
		 * frames, is around ΔE00 2: sage renders at 1.9 and iceberg at 2.1.
		 *
		 * Lightness alone cannot buy that. Every ink in the palette is measured
		 * against `canvas`, so each step down costs contrast, and `elevated` is
		 * pinned near white with nothing above it. The lever that is free is
		 * chroma: ΔE00 has a chroma axis and a contrast ratio does not, so at a
		 * fixed L* the ramp can separate itself by warmth at zero cost to any
		 * assertion. So the ladder now runs warmer as it runs deeper — b* 1.55,
		 * 3.59, 5.42, 7.52 from `elevated` down to `sunken` — which is how a
		 * stack of real paper behaves, and it is the same move that makes
		 * sage's near-white ramp legible where this one was not.
		 *
		 * Adjacent steps now measure ΔE00 2.25 / 2.31 / 2.25 (ratios 1.0536,
		 * 1.0688, 1.0657), so the gate's floor is cleared with room rather than
		 * scraped: `surface` used to be #fcfbf7 at 1.0267 against `elevated`,
		 * under the floor and passing only because the gate rounded before it
		 * compared. The cost is 0.15 of contrast on the semantics measured
		 * against `canvas` — `success` goes 4.78:1 to 4.62:1 — which is spent,
		 * not free, and is why no further depth is taken here.
		 *
		 * Change one of these four and re-run `pnpm check-themes`; they are a
		 * ladder and only make sense relative to each other.
