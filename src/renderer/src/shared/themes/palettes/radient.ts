		// Pure white was the one value in this file that belonged to no ramp: at

		// theme's own ink ladder. This continues that ladder — the chroma of the
		// three weights below it falls 14.5, 13.8, 9.1 as lightness rises, so the
		// primary ink lands at C3 on the same blue hue, and still measures 17:1
		// on canvas against white's 18.3:1.
		ink: "#F2F7FC",
		// The old secondary text was the light blue BDF0FD. Accent-weight colour on
		// every piece of secondary text is what the one-accent rule exists to stop,
		// so secondary text is now a cool blue-grey on the same ramp. BDF0FD is not
		// lost: it was also primary.light and is now accentHover.
