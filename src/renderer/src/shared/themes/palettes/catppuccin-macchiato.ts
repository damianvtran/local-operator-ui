/**
 * Catppuccin Macchiato — the fourth flavour, from catppuccin/palette v1.8.0.
 *
 * Every content value is canonical and unmodified: base 24273A, mantle 1E2132, text CAD3F5,
 * subtext1 B8C0E0, overlay0 6E738D, and the mauve/green/peach/red/blue accent row. Macchiato's
 * darker base gives every hue more room than frappé's does — the weakest value in the palette
 * is the red at 5.01:1 across all four grounds, against frappé's 3.76 for the same role — so
 * nothing here needed a solve.
 *
 * Frappé and macchiato are close cousins, and the risk in shipping both is shipping one theme
 * twice. Upstream separates them at the GROUND (base 303446 vs 24273A, ΔE00 4.22) and this
 * keeps that separation rather than splitting the difference: each ramp is built from its own
 * flavour's base and mantle, so the two ladders stay 3.5-4.2 apart at every rung instead of
 * converging on a shared mid-slate.
 *
 * The one rung that is not upstream's own tone is `inkDim`: subtext0 A5ADCB sits ΔE00 5.2 from
 * subtext1, under this contract's 8 ink step, so the readout tier skips it for overlay2 — which
 * is upstream's next tone down, lifted a hundredth to hold 4.5:1 on the binding ground.
 *
 * Roles the scheme has no token for follow one rule each: `chartBarHover` steps the accent
 * away from the plot ground until it clears ΔE00 10 from `accent`; a semantic wash is the hue
 * tinted over `canvas` at the strongest alpha that keeps its own ink at 4.5:1; a semantic
 * border walks its hue toward the ground to just above the 3:1 edge floor; the shadow and the
 * scrim are the ground tinted.
 *
 * ## The legibility pass, and what this file's numbers mean
 *
 * The grounds, ink weights and edges in this file were re-authored against the
 * pass's floors (see `docs/branding.md` § 2-3 and `scripts/contrast-contract.mjs`,
 * which asserts all of them): no page ground below L* 12 in a dark theme or above
 * L* 94 in a light one, a `surface` 2.5-5.0 L* above the canvas, an `elevated`
 * 2.5-6.0 above that, a `sunken` 1.5-6.0 below it, and the three ink weights at
 * 7.0 / 5.5 / 5.0:1 on all SIX grounds - the four elevation steps plus the two
 * that carry state, `accentWash` and `highlight`.
 *
 * Every other measurement quoted below was taken when the role above it was
 * authored, against the ground values as they stood THEN - a measurement is of a
 * moment, and this repository keeps the reading rather than silently refreshing
 * it. The pass's own values are the numbers in the blocks it added; the ones it
 * did not touch are unchanged and still measure what they say.

		 * ROW STATES, and `highlight` retired in the same change. Both roles are tints of
		 * THIS palette's own `accent` hue at two strengths; the retired role was a step

		 * reported as spent. The rule, and why neither role is a neutral step, are in the
		 * two roles' doc in `palette-contract.ts`.

		 *
		 * RE-SOLVED ON THE RELAXED ROW RULE. It shipped at C* 24.24 - past the
		 * min(0.75 x C*(accent), 24) ceiling - because the old 6.0 separation made
		 * the fill chase chroma to out-rank the hover. The separation rides the
		 * `accent` bar and `font-medium` now, so the value is authored by the rule's
		 * own order instead: the largest `L*` step the inks allow, then the smallest
		 * chroma that reaches the 4.0 band. `inkDim` binds at 5.03:1 on the fill.
		 * (The comment this replaces recorded the bar at 0.00:1; it measures 5.76:1.)
