 * Sage.
 *
 * A light theme, and the hardest of the ten to raise to the floors, because
 * its identity colour — celadon B2CEB3 — is lighter than the paper it has to
 * be legible on. The ramp and the accent both had to move; the celadon
 * itself survives as the accent wash, which is where it was already doing
 * most of its work.

		// The old theme paired a FDF9F1 page with FFFFFF paper. Elevation here is a
		// lightness step and white is the ceiling, so that ramp has no room for the
		// two grounds above surface. The whole floral-white ramp is re-seated one
		// step lower, which buys four distinguishable grounds and keeps the paper
		// warm rather than grey.
		// Elevated is already within a hair of white, so the canvas/surface step has
		// to be bought from below: F5F0E2 sat ΔE00 1.91 from surface, and two units
		// down the same warm ramp reads 2.24 while keeping 3.04 down to sunken.

		// This theme has no informational hue of its own, and a blue is the only
		// cool colour in it — which is why `info` used to be the accent triple.
		// That made it the accent green exactly, ΔE00 0 from `accent` and 8.4
		// from `success`: the same defect this file already fixed one row up,
		// where `warning` rotated to ochre because a yellow-green 24 degrees
		// from the success green could not be told apart at callout size. A
		// semantic that cannot be told from another semantic is not a semantic.
		//
		// So it is a blue, and the warmest one available: Lab hue 276 leans to
		// the red side rather than toward cyan, and C*36 sits between the muted
		// accent (27) and the fuller success/warning/danger (45-53), so it
		// reads as a member of this palette rather than a swatch borrowed from
		// a cooler one. Now ΔE00 46.9 from `success` and 36.8 from `accent`.
		info: "#3C67A1",
		// The wash and the border are seated by loudness, not by eye. Sage's
		// other four washes sit ΔE00 3.98-5.70 from `canvas` — the tightest
		// family in the twelve palettes, because each is a warm tint of a warm
		// paper and hue costs nothing when the hue already matches. The first
		// blue wash tried here sat at 13.75: 2.4x the loudest of the family it
		// had just joined, so the one callout that means "nothing is wrong"
		// shouted over the one that means "this failed".
		//
		// On paper this warm, that loudness is bought entirely by hue, not by
		// lightness or chroma — the old wash was already at the family's L* and
		// chroma. Measured against this canvas, a wash at b* 0 costs 6.16 and
		// b* -1 costs 7.10, both already over the family's ceiling. So the fill
		// stops at the coolest point the budget reaches (b* +1.0, ΔE00 5.52,
		// between `successWash` 5.54 and `dangerWash` 5.70) and reads cool by
		// being neutral beside cream rather than by being blue. The blue moves
		// to the border, which is where `warning` already keeps its ochre.
		infoWash: "#E9E9E7",
		// Lab hue 276, the same as `info` itself, at L*56.4 and 3.09:1 against
		// canvas — the family's own border lightness (56.4/56.6/56.5) and its
		// own contrast (3.09/3.07/3.08). It carries more chroma than the border
		// it replaces, not less: with the fill neutral the edge is what says
		// which callout this is, and its ΔE00 from canvas is unchanged at 38.
