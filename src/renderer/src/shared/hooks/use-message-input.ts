		 * moves box -> transcript in a single frame. That is true on the
		 * existing-session path and false on the New-chat one: a staged draft has

		 * app had already emptied and a transcript that had nothing in it - which
		 * reads as the message having been thrown away.
		 *
		 * So the clear is no longer the submit's to time. `onEchoPainted` fires
		 * when the echo has been applied to a mounted transcript, and that is the
		 * only thing that clears the box: synchronously with the echo on the
		 * existing-session path (still one frame), and at the remount on the draft
		 * path, where the box the user is looking at is the new panel's - already
		 * empty - and the message is in that panel's first painted frame.
		 *
		 * The payload is still captured ONCE and threaded through every consumer
