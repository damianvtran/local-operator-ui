/**
 * The Team Bridge page: a Slack-shaped rail, a thread and a composer.
 *
 * WHY A PAGE AND NOT A DIALOG. A conversation is a place a person returns to,
 * reads a history in and types in; a dialog would put the inbox in front of
 * the work and close on the first outside click.
 *
 * THE RAIL IS SLACK'S (operator review, 2026-10-21): Channels (the built-in
 * #humans and #agents first), Groups, People and Chiefs of staff, each with a
 * header that stays when the section is empty. A person's row IS their DM, so
 * there is never a second "@ Ben" row; see `team-bridge-rail.tsx`.
 *
 * NOTHING IS CREATED BY A CLICK. Selecting a person, a chief of staff or a
 * compose draft shows the thread if it exists and an empty, addressed draft
 * if it does not. The FIRST SEND creates the conversation (find-or-create for
 * a DM) and then posts the message with the same idempotency key, so a
 * double click, a second window or a retried send all converge on one thread.
 * This is the "consistent layer" the operator asked for: every conversation
 * the rail shows exists because someone said something in it.
 *
 * THE VIEW IS PURE. `TeamBridgePageView` takes its state as props; the
 * container below is the only place that knows about queries, which is what
 * lets the stories render every state without a backend.
 *
 * LAYOUT. Panels run the full height of the window and are separated by
 * ground (`canvas` rail, `surface` thread), never by a rule; the top inset is
 * padding inside each panel (`--panel-top-pad`), not an offset of the panel.
 */

/**
 * A failed directory read, with the cause named.
 *
 * The People section is the one place a reader goes to find a colleague, so a
 * generic "could not be loaded" is not actionable: a signed-out viewer must be
 * told to sign in (and not offered a Try again that cannot work), an org whose
 * plan does not include the bridge must say so, and only a transport/server
 * failure earns a retry. The status/code classification lives in the model so
 * the view does not parse errors.
