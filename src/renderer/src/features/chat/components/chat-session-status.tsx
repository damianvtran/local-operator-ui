				 *
				 * Gated on `unreadMark`, not on `row.attention?.unseen`, and the gating
				 * is the contract rather than a preference: this module's own test
				 * asserts that an ACKNOWLEDGED row renders IDENTICALLY to an
				 * unacknowledged one for every code that draws NO mark, so an
				 * unconditional suffix changes what an acknowledged busy, wedged or
				 * gated row says — and a busy row claiming ", unread" is the reported
				 * defect in the one place the ink cannot show it.
				 *
				 * The marks are the predicate's three: `complete`, and the `error` and
				 * `interrupted` codes the runtime labels "Unseen error" / "Unseen
				 * interruption" and ranks as outstanding completions.
				 *
				 * THE TWO FAILURE CODES THEREFORE SAY "UNSEEN" TWICE — "Unseen error,
				 * unread" — and that redundancy is ACCEPTED rather than trimmed (design
				 * D4 and QA Q-2 both raised it). Gating the suffix on `unreadMark ===
				 * "complete"` would be a SECOND rule about which codes carry the
				 * suffix, which is the two-derivations class this whole change removes:
				 * the suffix would become the check's property rather than the mark's,
				 * and a counted row's name would say nothing about the mark it draws.
				 * It is also the CLIENT's own statement of the level, where the
				 * "Unseen" in the label is the backend's word for it — which is what
				 * keeps the name true if that label is ever reworded for a code whose
				 * ink does not step between read and unseen.
