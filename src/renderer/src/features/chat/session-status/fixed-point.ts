/**
 * Python's fixed-precision formatting, reproduced exactly.
 *
 * ONE function, and every number the session strip prints goes through it.
 * That is the whole point: the readings exist to show the same value the TUI
 * shows, so the rounding rule has to be the TUI's rounding rule and there has
 * to be exactly one copy of it.
 *
 * ## The defect this replaces
 *
 * `Number.prototype.toFixed` rounds **half away from zero**. Python's
 * `format(x, ".1f")` — which is what every f-string in `status_line.py` and
 * `frontend_state.py` compiles to — rounds **half to even**, on the value's
 * EXACT binary expansion. The two disagree at every representable tie, and the
 * ties are reachable: over every integer token count, 91 of 199,901 readings on
 * a 200k window and 1 in 351 on a 32k window printed a different percentage
 * (review round 1, R1/Q1). Through the real TUI widget, the same session state
 * rendered `1.2%/200k` in the band and `1.3%/200k` in this strip.
 *
 * ## Why an exact-decimal implementation rather than `Intl.NumberFormat`
 *
 * `Intl.NumberFormat` gained `roundingMode: "halfEven"`, and it is the obvious
 * answer, and it is wrong here. It rounds the number's SHORTEST DECIMAL
 * REPRESENTATION, not its exact binary value, so it treats a literal that
 * merely looks like a tie as one:
 *
 * ```
 *                 exact binary value                 Python   Intl halfEven
 *   12.345   12.34500000000000063948846218409...     12.35    12.34   (wrong)
 *    2.675   2.67499999999999982236431605997...       2.67     2.68   (wrong)
 * ```
 *
 * Both of those are NOT ties — the stored double sits just above or just below
 * the midpoint — and Python's answer follows from the bits, not from how the
 * literal was typed. An implementation that reads the bits is the only one that
 * agrees on both the real ties and the near-ties, so this expands the double
 * itself.
 *
 * ## Why it is exact
 *
 * Every finite IEEE-754 double is `mantissa x 2^e` for integers `mantissa` and
 * `e`, and therefore has a FINITE decimal expansion: multiplying by `2^-e` for
 * negative `e` is multiplying by `5^-e` and shifting the decimal point. So the
 * value is carried here as a `BigInt` numerator over a power of ten with no
 * rounding anywhere, and the single rounding step at the end is the one the
 * caller asked for. No floating-point arithmetic happens after the bits are
 * read, which is what makes this exact rather than merely more accurate.
 *
 * Source of the rule: CPython's `float.__format__` -> `PyOS_double_to_string`
 * with `'f'` and an explicit precision, which is round-half-to-even on the
 * exact value. What would make this mirror wrong is CPython changing that, or
 * a caller reaching for `toFixed` directly instead of coming through here.
