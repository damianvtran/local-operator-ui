 * two conditions for it, both about the turn rather than the record:
 *
 * 1. the row is the turn's LAST row that paints anything the turn itself did — a
 *    turn that ends on a ledger row has not handed the reader its answer yet, and
 *    a turn ending on prose that is still streaming has not either, so neither is
 *    captioned. A STATEMENT row at the end is not the turn's work at all, so the
 *    answer before it still closes the turn and keeps its caption
 *    (`isStatementRow`, design round 2's D2-1);
 * 2. that row is a settled assistant record with text in it, which is
 *    `paintsSomething` plus the liveness bit — an unfinished answer closes a turn
 *    without being an answer.
 *
 * A turn is the records between two user records. The user turn itself is never
 * a candidate: its bubble carries the caption on the other rail.

 * message and the live `SteeringDeliveredEvent` is consumed by the stream, not
 * the transcript), so the partition can only be structural, and these facts are
 * the ones the record list actually states.
 *
 * WHY THE BOUNDARY VOCABULARY AND NOT A LOCAL COPY (the operator's own report,
 * 2026-09-30). This test used to read `isCompletionMarker` — `notice &&
 * complete === true` — while the pin list, the classifier and the rows' own paint
 * all read `boundaryKindOf`. The two agreed by copy, and they diverged at the
 * error-level `custom` a `session_incident` is: a terminal marker the rest of the
 * transcript honours, and one this test ignored. So `[session_incident][user]`
 * left `closed()` false, the reader's own FIRST message was absorbed as a steer,
 * and the bar over it was labelled "Steered" while the message sat inside the
 * hidden span. That is the last surviving copy of the four-way list the segments
 * module says it ended, and this is that copy fixed.
 *
 * WHY "NOTHING HAS RUN YET", which the vocabulary arm alone cannot cover. A
 * conversation OPENS with harness prefix rows — `system_prefix`, `selected_model`,
 * `session_mcp_unavailable` — that paint but are not `user` rows and are NOT
 * boundaries (an info-level `custom` is not terminal). The first of them opened
 * the run with `openingUserIndex: null`, so EVERY fresh conversation's first user
 * message steered into a head-cut run that held nothing. A steer is a message to
 * an agent that is WORKING; a run that opens off a non-user row and holds no work
 * of its own — no tool row, no assistant row — is not a turn in flight, it is an
 * empty preamble, so a following user message OPENS its own run. The test needs
 * both halves: it fires only while the run opens off a non-user row AND nothing
 * in it has painted work, so a `[user][user]` pair keeps today's steer semantics
 * (a turn the reader opened is in flight even before its first call).
 *
 * `recordOf` lets the same walk serve records and `Row`s: `Row`s only wrap a
 * subset of records, and each caller needs spans in its own index space.

/**
 * Does this record paint anything the reader can see?
 *
 * For an assistant record the answer is its TEXT, and nothing else. An empty
 * one paints nothing whether it is finished or still streaming. Both halves of
 * that are deliberate: the streaming case is the "Writing" row discussed below,
 * and the SETTLED case — a finished assistant record that never carried prose,
 * because its tool rows were the whole turn — is the invisible-row trap
 * immediately below. One predicate covers both because they are the same fact:
 * a record with nothing in it.
 *
 * THE INVISIBLE-ROW TRAP, because this is exactly the kind of thing that gets
 * reintroduced. The reducer deliberately KEEPS an assistant record that carried
 * only tool calls: it has no prose to show — its tool rows carry the turn — but
 * it still owns its backend id so a live echo of the same turn coalesces onto
 * it instead of duplicating it (see the reducer's durable branch, "An assistant
 * row that only carried tool calls has no prose to show… It still occupies its
 * id"). Deleting it there is not an option.
 *
 * So it must exist in the RECORD list and must never reach the ROW list. When
 * it did, it cost the transcript twice over: it minted a wrapper carrying a top
 * margin for a box of zero height, AND — because the gap tier is decided from
 * the PREVIOUS record — it broke the trace-adjacency chain, so the next tool
 * row fell back to the wider `item` tier. Measured on the shipped build: two
 * adjacent tool rows 48px apart where a tight pair was 28px, at exactly the
 * points where the model happened to emit a prose-free tool turn. That is the
 * "extra space randomly inserted which doesn't look very uniform" in the
 * operator's report — the gap had no visible cause because its cause was
 * invisible.
 *
 * ## Why `streaming` is NOT a reason to paint
 *
 * It used to be. A streaming record with no text yet is the gap between
 * `message_start` and the first token, and the transcript minted a row for it
 * that read "Writing" — which put a second liveness element directly above the
 * working line, where that line was already saying `thinking`. Two elements for
 * one fact, and the redundant one sat in the ANSWER's register rather than on
 * the ledger, so it read as the turn having started when nothing had been
 * written.
 *
 * The TUI has one aggregate liveness element and no per-record equivalent
 * (`WorkingBlock`, `tui/widgets/transcript.py`), and the working line here is
 * the port of it: its `thinking` → `composing N calls` → `waiting to run N
 * calls` → `running` → `responding` ladder already covers every state this row
 * could have described, including composing tool calls, which paint as
 * `composing · N B` on their own tool rows, a call whose dictation has finished
 * and which nothing has started (`queued · N B`), and a call the harness will
 * never run (`never sent · N composed`) — by the harness's own verdict, or
 * because the turn ended while the call was still being dictated or waiting to
 * run, which the TUI settles with the same record. So liveness has ONE channel,
 * and a record with nothing in it paints nothing.
 *
 * ### The safety net that went with it, and why it is not needed
 *
 * The old `|| record.streaming` branch also covered a DESYNC: if a record said
 * it was streaming while the working line was suppressed, the "Writing" row was
 * the only thing left moving. The two are not derived from the same thing by
 * accident — the working line's visibility keys on the SESSION-level
 * `frontend.streaming` flag (`chat-page.tsx` reads
 * `canonical.frontend?.streaming` into `busy`, which arrives here as `waiting`
 * via `chat-content.tsx`), not on
 * any record in the list, so it is live for the whole provider call regardless
 * of what the record list currently holds — and `agent_end` settles the record
 * and that flag together. What USED to be offered as the second half of that
 * argument no longer holds, and is restated here rather than left standing
 * (code review round 1, R1-4): the claim was that `dropLiveRecords` cleared live
 * records on every gap, so nothing could leave one true and the other false.
 * A gap now KEEPS its streaming rows and marks them uncertain
 * (`markLiveRecordsTruncated`), so "a row says it is streaming while the
 * session-level flag says it is not" IS reachable by the normal event path: the
 * gap drops `frontend` to `null` — which is what the pane's reconnecting state
 * reads — while the row it was writing stays on screen, and it is the intended
 * state rather than a desync (the row keeps the text this viewer received; the
 * pane stops claiming a session state it cannot prove). The row is therefore NOT
 * painted from a per-record liveness rule: it is a real row with real text, and
 * the working line is suppressed independently of it. If a future change derives
 * `waiting` from the record list instead, this net has to come back with it.
 *
 * ### The 46.4px step at the first token, accepted deliberately
 *
 * Removing the row unmasked a real motion: before the first token the working
 * line is alone in the column, and at the first token the avatar and the first
 * line of prose appear ABOVE it, so the working line drops from top 96.4 to
 * 142.8 at 1024 — 46.4px in one frame (design review round 1, D5, measured
 * across the two consecutive states). This is accepted, not overlooked.
 *
 * It is legible rather than glitchy: what pushes the status line down is the
 * answer the reader is waiting for, and a status line yielding to content is an
 * event with a cause on screen. The alternative — showing the avatar before the
 * first token so the gutter is already occupied — removes only the horizontal
 * half of the step, adds an avatar that then has to move again when the prose
 * row mounts under it, and the version that removes the step entirely is the
 * avatar taking a real flex slot, which is the row restructure
 * `message-container.tsx` documents as deliberately deferred with a measured
 * collision. Paying that for 46.4px is the wrong trade; if the step is ever
 * reported, fix it there rather than by reinstating a row.
 *
 * Adjacency and spacing are therefore computed over what the reader can SEE,
 * never over what the record list contains. `AssistantRow` returns `null` on
 * this same predicate rather than on a copy of the condition, because two
 * copies of it are how the row comes back.

/**
 * The vertical ladder, `[comfortable, small view]`.
 *
 * Five tiers, and the DISTANCE BETWEEN TIERS is the information: a reader tells
 * "still the same run" from "a new turn started" by the size of the gap alone,
 * because nothing else on the surface marks a boundary (§ 2: remove a border
 * before you tighten the spacing — there are no borders left here to remove).
 *
 * - `trace` is a 2px HAIRLINE. Adjacent ledger rows read as one block the eye
 *   runs down rather than as a list of separated items — the operator's "much
 *   too wide" and the TUI reference's ~20.4px per line — but they are not
 *   fused: at zero the run was one unbroken column in which a reader looking
 *   for where one call ended and the next began had only the text to go on.
 *   Two pixels is the smallest step that reinstates that boundary, and it is
 *   deliberately NOT four: the designer rendered the same run at both, and at
 *   4px the rows float as separate items again, which is the spacing this
 *   whole tier was tightened away from. So a run of N rows measures
 *   `N × 20px + (N-1) × 2px` — the tool row's dense trigger is 20px — and
 *   uniformity is still structural rather than lucky, because every adjacent
 *   like pair gets the same tier and therefore the same distance.
 * - `item` separates the two REGISTERS (prose and ledger) inside one agent
 *   turn. Small, but four times the hairline: proportional prose sitting flush
 *   on a monospace row reads as one wrapped paragraph.
 * - `turn` is deliberately left wide. Tightening a run is only correct if the
 *   turn boundary survives it, and the contrast is what carries the hierarchy —
 *   24px against 2px inside a run in the comfortable view, where it used to be
 *   24px against 4px. In the SMALL view that contrast is 16px against the same
 *   2px (`turn` is `mt-4` there), which is a smaller ratio but still an order of
 *   magnitude, and it is the narrower column's own doing rather than this tier's.
 * - `mark` attaches a truncated row's own caption TO that row rather than to the
 *   paragraph above it (design round 1, D1). Without it the caption's only
 *   separation from the row above was the 8px `item` gap while its own margin to
 *   the chunk is 4px — a 2:1 ratio between two values that both sit inside a
 *   component's tier, so neither side read as a boundary and the line parsed as a
 *   note on the paragraph above it, which is a COMPLETE answer under it. It takes
 *   the ramp's between-components step, 12px, against the caption's 4px: 3:1, and
 *   a boundary larger than anything inside a paragraph (the prose's own line
 *   pitch is 24px, so the ratio is what has to carry it, not the absolute value).
 *   It is the FIRST tier pinned across both views — 12px is the smallest honest
 *   value and the small view's own `item` is 6px, so shrinking it would put the
 *   caption back below its own floor.
 *
 * The hairline does NOT shrink in the small view, unlike every other tier — it
 * is the only TIER whose two values are equal in the table below (`first` also
 * carries two identical entries, but its pair is empty: it is the absence of a
 * margin, not a width held across both views). The tiers above
 * shrink because they are made of several pixels to spend; 2px is already the
 * floor at which a gap is still a gap, and 1px on a hairline reads as an
 * antialiasing artifact rather than as a boundary. Note that this is therefore
 * not photographable: with one value in both views no frame can distinguish
 * them, and the property is pinned by the test over `GAP.trace`'s two indices
 * instead (`scripts/tool-row.test.mjs`).
