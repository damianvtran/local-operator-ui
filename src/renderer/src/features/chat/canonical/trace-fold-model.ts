/**
 * The aggregation tier's arithmetic, as a pure model (§E2, amendment A3).
 *
 * A turn of forty tool calls is forty lines today, and the reader's question at
 * the top of such a turn is "what did it do", not "what was call thirty-one". So
 * a run of three or more consecutive actions inside one turn FOLDS into one
 * summary line whose copy is generated from the counts by class.
 *
 * Everything with a right answer lives here rather than in the component: which
 * rows fold, what the summary says, and what a turn's foot line reports are all
 * questions a test can ask without rendering anything (`scripts/trace-fold-model.test.mjs`).
 * The component's half is the disclosure and the frames.
 *
 * ## What the CONDENSED header carries, and why it lives here too
 *
 * A collapsed group has to answer two questions on its own, because the rows
 * that would answer them are unmounted: what the run has DONE (the summary —
 * the counts by class, or `foldCounts` when no sentence can phrase it) and what
 * it is doing RIGHT NOW (`foldLive`: the in-flight call's own label, which is
 * the operator's sharpest point — a collapsed group that hides the live command
 * is worse than no group at all). It also carries the run's wall-clock span
 * (`foldSpan`: first start to last completion, never a sum of the rows'
 * durations, which is what read `0s` beside a run of fast calls). All three are
 * arithmetic over the row list, so all three are here and tested here.
 *
 * ## What a fold is NOT
 *
 * It is a VIEW, never a reorder. Folding hides rows; it does not group them into
 * a new parent that could claim a different position in the transcript. That is
 * branding §7's placement rule, and the transcript already has a guard for the
 * ordering half of it (`applyLiveSeed`/`withTimeOrder`) which a reordering fold
 * would quietly defeat. `foldRuns` therefore returns the rows in the order it
 * received them, always - the fold's own id is derived from its first row, so a
 * fold can never sort ahead of the action it starts with.
 *
 * ## Why the counts are by CLASS and not by tool
 *
 * `Ran pnpm vitest run` and `Ran pnpm vitest run --coverage` are one activity to
 * a reader, and so are four different `read` calls. The classes below are the
 * ones §E2 names; anything the app does not classify never joins a class - the
 * summary falls to the counts by KIND, where the unknown counts under its own
 * display name (`2 files · 1 create_issue`). A bare total appears only for an
 * empty run (0 actions), where there is nothing else true to say.
 *
 * The meta tools whose ONE name spans reads and writes (`agent`, `team`,
 * `hub`) are deliberately in neither sentence table. `agent` used to be filed
 * with `task` as delegation, so three agent-profile READS painted `Delegated`
 * rows and folded into `delegated 3 tasks` - the operator's report of
 * 2026-09-27 - while no single class sentence is true for all eight of its
 * ops. Delegation means `task` and `delegate`, the calls that actually hand
 * work off; everything else counts by kind under its own noun
 * (`4 files · 3 agents`), which is the same fallback an unknown name takes.

 * majority classes summarised as `and N other actions`.
 *
 * THE TAIL COUNTS CALLS, NOT TYPES, and the same unit every other number on
 * the line counts (the bar's `N actions`, the foot's `N actions`), so a reader
 * who sums the segments still reaches the turn's action count; the number of
 * hidden TYPES is deliberately not stated, because `and N other actions` is a

 * slots (files, searches, web, the command kinds `shell`/`python` in the

 * operator's report used (`agent`, `team`, `hub`); every other kind follows
 * those, sorted by count and then by its noun. So the tail is always what the
 * line's own order already ranked least-major - which is also why a run with
 * many `agent` calls can push a rarer named kind into the tail - and at N or
 * fewer units the line is byte-identical to what it has always been. Five is
 * chosen against the report's own run: it keeps the three classes the run was

 * than a picture: the count takes the slot the FIFTH picture would have had. The
 * narrowest column this strip renders in was measured at 556px of strip width (a
 * 640px window: 576px of column minus the strip's own 20px indent; the live
 * window's column is wider), so the arithmetic is, in strip terms:
 *
 *     4 x 117 + 4 x 8 + control = 500 + control <= 556   =>   control <= 56px
 *
 * and the control is 33.6px (`+4`), 39.3px (`+10`), 41.4px (`+99`): the row is
 * 541.4px at its worst (`+99`), 14.6px inside the column. In WINDOW terms - which
 * is how a reader meets it - the strip is the window minus 84px (the transcript's
 * 2 x `p-8` and the strip's `ml-5`), so the row needs a window of 541.4 + 84 =
 * ~626px at its worst and 533.6 + 84 = ~618px for `+4`. Against the row this
 * replaces - 98px tiles and `+N more images`, 111.1px at `+4` and 118.9px at
 * `+99` - that is 535.1 / 542.9px of strip, ~619 / ~627px of window (the UX round
 * measured the old floor between a 620px and a 600px window), so like for like the
 * floor does not rise: it falls by ~1.5px at either digit count, while the tile
 * gets 42% more area. The narrow label is what pays for it: with the full noun the
 * same 117px tile would need 4 x 117 + 32 + 118.9 = 618.9px of strip, ~703px of
 * window, which is past the 640px window this layout is modelled on.
 *
 * Because a tile is this wide, FIVE tiles (617px) no longer fit one row: the
 * cap is therefore the slot count, and a run of exactly five pictures draws four
 * tiles and a `+1`, the same shape every larger count has. Capping at all is
 * what keeps the height at one row for any count: without it a run of 25-30
 * pictures costs ~391px at the old size, more than the ~338.7px an EXPANDED group
 * costs - the one case where condensing would be the taller choice (design review
