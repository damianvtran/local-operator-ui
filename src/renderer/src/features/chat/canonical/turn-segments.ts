/**
 * Which message is a turn's ANSWER, and how a run's hidden span partitions into
 * SEGMENTS around the rows that must stay on screen (issue #665; loader-continuity
 * PR 2).
 *
 * PURE, STRUCTURAL, AND IN ONE MODULE. Rows in, classification out: no React, no
 * DOM, no clock, and NO TEXT HEURISTICS. The classifier reads record KINDS and the
 * two facts the reducer already decided (`customType`, `level`/`complete`), because
 * the alternatives were measured and lose: `stop_reason` reads `"stop"` on every
 * durable stop-then-step pair (549 of 549 in the journals sampled), the completion
 * marker's anchor is absent for wake-triggered turns, and "does it read like an
 * answer" breaks on a three-word reply. The caption (`closingAnswerIds`), the
 * foot line, the bar's facts and the render walk all read THIS module's answer, so
 * they cannot disagree about which row the turn is handing over - the defect this
 * replaces was one wrong closure that was wrong in five places at once.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG (the operator's own journal, kinds only). A turn is closed by the
 * LAST settled assistant row. In the journal behind the operator's screenshot the
 * agent answered (row 1196), the session was disposed, and a later peer note made
 * it write one more short reply (row 1229). The old rule elected 1229, so the
 * bar swallowed the real answer and the reader was handed a status snippet.
 *
 * THE MODEL, in the vocabulary the rest of this file uses:
 *
 * - a STEP row is a `tool` row: work the turn did;
 * - a TRIGGER row says why the agent is about to act: a `user` row, a `peer`
 *   message, a `wake` delivery, or a `custom` `job_result` / `hub_message` /
 *   `monitor_prompt`. Every other statement (`notice`, `compaction`, the other
 *   `custom` rows) is neither;
 * - a CLOSE row is a settled, text-bearing assistant row that is NOT followed by a
 *   step row before the next trigger or the run's end. Text followed by a step is
 *   narration ("Checking the ledger first."), and narration is not a close;
 * - A SETTLED QUIET CALL IS ALSO A CLOSE (design §5, rev 2): a `no_reply` row
 *   whose call finished ends its cycle without handing the reader anything. It is
 *   a close for every CLOSURE consumer (the cycle chain, `settledCloseOf`'s tail,
 *   the walk's run boundary) and a CANDIDATE for none of the ones that hand
 *   something over (`electAnswer` excludes it, so no caption, foot or stamp
 *   claims an answer). See `isQuietTurnClose` for why the name is the signal;
 * - a CYCLE is one agent response: the rows since the previous close, ending at
 *   this close. A run is a chain of cycles.
 *
 * Each cycle is a RESPONSE (the agent answering the reader, directly or by
 * finishing work it had started) or COMMENTARY (the agent reacting to something
 * ambient after the answer was already handed over). The turn's ANSWER is the
 * close of the LAST response cycle - not the last message emitted.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS ON SCREEN is a SEPARATE question from what the answer is, and it has
 * its own invariant (see `partitionRun`): a settled, text-bearing row stays
 * visible when it is the close of a RESPONSE cycle (V1), the run's LAST close
 * whatever its class (V2), a `user` row (V3), or a row the provider declared
 * finished (V4) - plus the pinned rows, as before. NOT COVERED, stated plainly
 * because a review round found it: a COMMENTARY close that is neither the run's
 * last close nor `stop`-declared, with nothing but more assistant text after it,
 * still hides. That is one row in the frozen 15,130-run corpus (agent review round 1
 * found the same single row in its own 15,125-run reading) - rare but real, and it
 * is the original complaint in miniature (the close shown after it is shorter than
 * the one hidden). Several closes can therefore be visible at
 * once while the turn still has exactly one elected answer - the answer is what
 * the foot, the stamp and the caption key on, and nothing here changes that.

 * The durable reducer keeps that field on every text-bearing assistant row
 * (`transcript-reducer.ts:2264`), so this reads a fact the record already states.
 *
 * WHY A DECLARATION AND NOT A LENGTH. The rows this rescues are the ones the
 * harness continued past: a `stop`-then-more-work pair is what the todo guardrail
 * manufactures by re-entering the loop after a no-tool-call yield. A corpus read
 * (the design note behind this change: 10,308 journals, 13,932 runs) found those
 * rows at 0.23 per run and a median 2,540 characters, while the narration that
 * must KEEP hiding (text carried in the same frame as its own `tool_calls`,
 * `stop_reason: "toolUse"`) numbered 203,412 at a median 122 - so "is it long"
 * would happen to separate them, and is still the wrong instrument: a phase says
 * what the model MEANT, and it keeps working for a terse report (the 261-character

 * at 3,841 = 1.51 % of prose rows and 0.254 per run.
 *
 * THE PHASE AND THE SHAPE BARELY DISAGREE, WHICH IS THE POINT. On the same frozen
 * corpus 20,933 rows declare `stop` and 233,783 declare `toolUse`, and the two
 * populations are almost disjoint in shape: only **4** of the 20,933 `stop` rows
 * carry their OWN `tool_calls` (the lead-in frame), and exactly **1** of the
 * 233,783 `toolUse` rows is not followed by a call. So a length test would happen
 * to separate them too - and would still be the wrong instrument, because it reads
 * the symptom while the phase reads what the model MEANT. The price of reading the
 * declaration is those 4 leading-in `stop` rows staying visible; the price of
 * reading the shape would be every terse report hiding again.
 *
 * UNKNOWN IS ABSENT. `null`/`undefined` never fires, so a record built without the
 * field behaves exactly as it did before this predicate existed. Where it bites: on
 * this machine's journals NO text-bearing assistant row lacks the field at all
 * (`null`/`undefined`: 0 rows; other reasons such as `aborted` / `length`: 285 =

 * row itself, the run's trailing statements (a receipt or notice after the last
 * close), every close of a RESPONSE cycle, the run's LAST close whatever its class,
 * every `user` row in the span, and any settled row whose own provider declaration
 * is `stop_reason: "stop"`. EVERYTHING ELSE in the span hides - the turn's work,
 * its narration, and every commentary cycle - and hides as SEGMENTS: the maximal
 * contiguous hidden spans between the visible rows.
 *
 * WHY MORE THAN THE ANSWER (the operator's report, "a fulsome response with
 * completion details that we'd want to see, but I have to click to expand"). The
 * old rule kept exactly one close, so a turn that answered, was continued past, and
 * answered again hid the FIRST answer - the one carrying the substance - inside the
 * bar, and the reader had to expand it to read what the agent had already handed
 * over. The four clauses below are the invariant that replaces it, in row-list
 * terms:
 *
 * - V1, a RESPONSE cycle's close: the agent answered something (the request, a job,
 *   a hub relay, a monitor prompt), so the reader is owed it;
 * - V2, the run's LAST close: the reader is owed the last word even when that cycle
 *   is commentary;
 * - V3, a `user` row: the one row in the span the READER wrote. A mid-turn steer
 *   used to be hidden with the work it steered and the bar had to say `Steered` to
 *   admit it (`labelOfSegment`); the surveyed harnesses all keep the reader's own
 *   message in place, and the cost is measured (11.6 % of runs gain one bar);
 * - V4, a settled row the provider declared finished (`reportsCompletedThought`).
 *
 * WHAT THE FOUR CLAUSES DO NOT COVER (the falsifier agent review round 1 on PR
 * #737 produced, and it is real): a COMMENTARY close that is neither the run's
 * last close (V2) nor `stop`-declared (V4), with no call after it, still hides -
 * e.g. `[N0][W][K][N3][N4]`, where `n3` is commentary and the row after it is
 * another assistant row, not a call. Incidence on this machine's journals: exactly
 * 1 row in the frozen 15,130-run corpus. It is kept as a known residual rather than
 * closed, because
 * the clause that would cover it - "any commentary close, visible" - would un-hide
 * the ambient chatter V1/V2 were already shaped to fold.
 *
 * A V4 ROW IS STILL NOT A CLOSE. It is visible while the run has more work after
 * it, so it splits its segment without splitting its cycle - `isClose`, `cyclesOf`
 * and `electAnswer` are untouched, and the turn keeps exactly ONE answer to carry
 * `closesTurn` (the foot and the one stamp). The segment machinery already renders
 * a visible group between two bars, so nothing else has to learn about it.
 *
 * WHY SEGMENTS AND NOT ONE BAR. A pinned row between two hidden spans (40% of the
 * runs in the journals sampled) used to render AFTER a bar that stood where the
 * first hidden row was, and jumped when the bar opened. Each span is its own bar
 * in its own slot, so a pinned row can never be reordered by expanding anything.
 *
 * THE DISPLAY MODE WIDENS, AND ONLY WIDENS (issue #756). `mode` is the reader's
 * `by-turn` / `by-response` choice (`transcript-display-mode.ts`), and it is an
 * OPTIONAL FIELD whose absence means the shipped default: `from` and the four
 * clauses above are computed identically in both modes, so V1-V4 keep their
 * meaning and `answer` is elected once, before the mode is consulted. `by-turn`
 * is therefore byte-for-byte the partition this function always produced; in
 * `by-response` EVERY settled text-bearing row joins the visible set on top of
 * the clauses, so a turn that answered, was continued past and answered again
 * shows both answers in place while its tool work still condenses. The widening
 * is one-directional by construction: nothing is ever REMOVED from `visible` for
 * a mode, so a row the invariant keeps stays kept, and the elected answer keeps
 * carrying the caption and the foot (`closesTurn`) rather than becoming one of
 * several undifferentiated rows.
 *
 * `from` is the first index the span may start at: just after the opening user
 * row, or 0 for a run whose head is cut off.

/**
 * What a segment's bar says about itself ahead of its clauses, or null for the
 * ordinary bar (whose copy - `Took ...`, `N actions` - is unchanged and needs no
 * word).
 *
 * ONE WORD PER CONCEPT, IN THE APP'S OWN NOUNS (design review round 1 on #708,
 * D2/D3). The first cut split the same trigger by position (`Woken` before the
 * answer, `Followed up` after; `Noted` / `Peer note`) and mixed three grammatical
 * registers. Position is already visible - the bar is above or below the answer -
 * so the word names only WHAT OPENED the cycle, as the noun the rest of the app
 * uses: the TUI's own labels for these rows are `wake` and `peer`, and the receipt
 * row prints the sender rather than a sentence about it.
 *
 * THE WORD COMES FROM THE CYCLE THE SEGMENT ENDS IN, not from any trigger row
 * that happens to lie inside it. A long user-opened turn is full of `job_result`
 * receipts between its steps; reading "the last trigger in the span" labelled that
 * whole bar `Job result`, which is not what it is. A cycle's INITIATORS are only
 * what preceded its first step, so a mid-work receipt cannot name the bar.
 *
 * | what the bar hides                         | label          |
 * |--------------------------------------------|----------------|
 * | a user row of the reader's own (a steer)   | Steered        |
 * | a cycle opened by a wake / monitor prompt  | Wake           |
 * | a cycle opened by a peer / hub message     | Peer message   |
 * | a cycle opened by a job result             | Job result     |
 * | anything else (the reader's own request)   | none           |
 *
 * `Steered` IS NOW A BACKSTOP, AND KEPT RATHER THAN DELETED. It shipped (agent
 * review round 1 on #708, R1-2) as the answer to "a reader's OWN message must not
 * disappear behind an unlabelled bar": the partition then hid a steer with the
 * work it steered, because pinning it would have split every steered turn into two
 * bars. The visibility invariant (V3, see `partitionRun`) took that trade back -
 * a `user` row is now never inside a span at all - so the arm above cannot fire
 * for a partition this module built, and its comment is the record of why.
 *
 * It stays because the FUNCTION is what promises the message is never swallowed:
 * `labelOfSegment` is exported and called on caller-supplied spans (and the
 * head-cut/first-page spans the loader can hand it), so removing the arm would
 * trade a one-word redundancy for the exact failure it was written to prevent.
 * `scripts/turn-segments.test.mjs` asserts both halves: no bar over a steer is
 * produced, and the word is what a span holding a user row would still be called.
 *
 * A QUIET GROUP OVERRIDES THE CYCLE OPENER (design §5): a span that IS a quiet
 * group (>= 2 trigger rows with nothing between them the reader can see) states
 * the family's plural word and its own count/span instead of one cycle's opener -
 * `Peer messages`, never `Peer message`, over twelve receipts. The group is
 * computed by the collapse model (which is where `isFailedCall` and the paint
 * predicates live) and handed IN, so this function keeps no second opinion about
 * what a group is; its only rule is the word.

 * rather than the ordinary work under the answer: a bar after the answer, and a
 * labelled bar (`Wake`, `Peer message`, `Job result`, `Steered`) before it. The

 *
